      ## About devanooga
      devanooga is an online resource for folks who like to tinker with technology in and around the Chattanooga area. Our organization is still young and far from fleshed out, and we want to hear your thoughts and ideas.
      
      [Get in touch with us](/slack) to learn more about how you can help shape this community.

      ## Our resources
      Our main resource is a [Slack Team](/slack), where technologists from all around the region come together to share ideas, troubleshoot their projects, learn new things, or just hang out. We keep a relaxed atmosphere in there, but we do expect you to heed our [Code of Conduct](/coc) (CoC). If you have any questions about the CoC, feel free to [use our contact form](/contact) to get in touch. You can also ask us on Slack, either publicly in the #general channel, or privately to any of the admins.
